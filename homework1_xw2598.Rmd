# *problem 1* 
Create a data frame comprised of:

A random sample of size 10 from a uniform[0, 5] distribution

A logical vector indicating whether elements of the sample are greater than 2

A (length-10) character vector

A (length-10) factor vector

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
dt_frame = tibble(
  random_sample = runif(10,0,5) ,
  logical_vector = random_sample > 2 ,
  ch_vector = c("a","b","c","d","e","f","g","h","i","j") ,
  factor_vector = as.factor(ch_vector) 
)
dt_frame = as.data.frame(dt_frame)
dt_frame

```
